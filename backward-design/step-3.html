    <h1>Step 2: Steep and press the coffee.</h1>
    <p><ul>
      <li><b>Pour the boiling water over your grounds in the carafe.</b></li>
      <li><b>Stir the grounds into the water with a long spoon.</b> Don't skip this step! You want to make sure the grounds are well mixed with the water.</li>
      <li><b>Let the coffee steep.</b> Steeping your coffee for about 5 minutes will give you decent coffee. If you want stronger coffee, let it steep for longer. For less strong coffee, let it steep for a shorter period of time.</li>
      <li><b>Press your coffee.</b> If you haven't already put your plunger and filter together, do so as shown in the image below. Usually, you will need to screw the cross plate on to the bottom to hold everything together. Once you have your plunger ready, gently press it into your coffee until you can't press down any further. You won't be able to press it all the way in, since there will be coffee grounds at the bottom!</li>
    </ul></p>
