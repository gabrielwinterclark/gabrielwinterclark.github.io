    <h1>Step 2: Prepare the grounds.</h1>
    <p><h2>Skills:</h2><ol>
      <li><b>Grind your beans</b>, if you need to! If you haven't bought pre-ground coffee beans, you will need to grind your beans using a bean grinder.</li>
      <li><b>Measure your grounds.</b> Use about one tablespoon of grounds per cup of coffee you'd like to make. If you want stronger coffee, use more grounds. Likewise, for less strong coffee, use fewer grounds.</li>
      <li><b>Add your grounds to the French press.</b> Take everything out of the carafe (i.e., the plunger, lid, and filter system) and put your coffee grounds into the carafe. If you're not familiar with what the parts of a French press are called, check out the image below!</li>
